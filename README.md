# CV-Plant-Seedling-Classification

Recognize, identify, and classify plant images using CNN and image recognition algorithms. The goal of the project is to create a classifier capable of determining a plant's species from a photo.

## Classes
- Black-grass
- Charlock
- Cleavers
- Common Chickweed
- Common wheat
- Fat Hen
- Loose Silky-bent
- Maize
- Scentless Mayweed
- Shepherdâ€™s Purse
- Small-flowered Cranesbill
- Sugar beet
